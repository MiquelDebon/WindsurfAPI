## Windsurf Weather API

This API tell you the best day/hour to do windsurf + **SEND MAIL**


The code get the data from **[open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/marine-weather-api#latitude=41.3888&longitude=2.159&start_date=2023-09-23&end_date=2023-09-28)**, 
filter this data to remove the bad weather and retrieve the best options.

#### Why this API?
Last summer, I joined a center to learn windsurfing. What happens is that they offer a package of 10 classes, and every Friday, they provide the schedule for the following week, and you must choose wisely. 

**You want wind but not waves, and at the same time, a sunny day**, so these three parameters can make it tricky sometimes to decide, but in the end, it's all about mathematics.
