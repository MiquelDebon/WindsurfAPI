#### Why this API?
Last summer, I joined a center to learn windsurfing. What happens is that they offer a package of 10 classes, and every Friday, they provide the schedule for the following week, and you must choose wisely. 

**You want wind but not waves, and at the same time, a sunny day**, so these three parameters can make it tricky sometimes to decide, but in the end, it's all about mathematics.
